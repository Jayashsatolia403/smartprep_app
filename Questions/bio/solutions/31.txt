An important characteristics that hemichordates and chorddates share is presence of pharyngeal gill slits. 
Gill slits are dorsal in position in hemichordates whereas they are lateral in chordates. A true unotochord does not occur in hemichordates.
Nervous system is distinctly of vertebrate type being intraepidermal in position and having a ventral nerve cord.

Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest gymnosperm. The leaves of gymnosperms are well adapted to extremes of climate. 
This is the reason for gymnosperm to flourish in cold areas where instead of rain, snow is the source of water. Gymnosperms are heterosporous i.e., produce two different kinds of sporesÂ­microspores and megaspores. Salvinia is an aquatic pteridophyte.

Phylum Porifera (the sponges) has cellular level of body organisation, with inner cellular layer consisting of highly specialised flagellated cells called choanocytes (or collar cells). 
The development in this phylum is indirect as it includes a free swimming larva called amphiblastula or parenchymula for dispersal of the species.

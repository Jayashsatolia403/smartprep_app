Plasmodium falciparum is a protozoan parasite, one of the species of Plasmodium that causes malaria in humans. Being digenetic, its life cycle is complete in two hosts — man and mosquito. \nIts sexual cycle is completed in female Anopheles mosquito and infective individuals called sporozoites are formed.\nWhich are transmitted to humans with the bite of infected female Anopheles. \nAsexual cycle is passed in man in two phases. Malaria caused by P. falciparum (also known as aestivo\xadautumnal, malignant tertian or pernicious malaria) is the most dangerous form of malaria, with the highest rate ofcomplication and mortality. In this case fever cycle is of 48 hours and is often fatal to patient as it affects the brain.\nScientific name of common house lizard is Hemidactylus whereas Musca domestica is the scientific name of common housefly.
